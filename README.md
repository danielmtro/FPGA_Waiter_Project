# FPGA_Waiter_Project
Makes a waiter that controls a robot to drive to table. The robot looks at the person, determines their ethinicity and sends a spice level out to everyone else.


## Plan for the day before

ALL MODULES ARE DONE - WOOO

# Integration Testing

Team 1: Get the state machine working based on the colour thresholding, frequency input.

Team 2: Get the image sending once the robot gets to the table.
